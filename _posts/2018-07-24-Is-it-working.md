title: Is it working?

Well, here we are.

Welcome folks, make yourself confortable.
As you might know, since you are here and there is no reference in the world to this website, I'm [Gabriel](http://www.linkedin.com/in/gabrielmpaula), I'm 29 and I'm from Brazil. I graduated in Mechatronic Engineering and I'm currently a scholar and a Master Candidate of  Management Science and Engineering in the [Tsinghua University](http://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/publish/thu2018en/index.html) in China.

Motivated by my girlfriend [Paula](http://www.linkedin.com/in/paula-rodriguez-65534642), my friend [Tiisetso](http://www.tiisetso.com) and the videos of [Siraj Raval](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWN3xxRkmTPmbKwht9FuE5A), I started this blog initially with the idea to take notes of some interesting topics that I study and have interest in. Part to improve my own learning and part to try to share some findings and contents that I will try to keep as simple as possible. However I realized that I don't want to limitate the content of the posts so far, so eventually something totally unrelated with anything might appear over here. Just deal with it.

Cheers,  
Gabriel Melo de Paula.
